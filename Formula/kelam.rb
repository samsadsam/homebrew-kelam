# Kelam CLI — build and run voice AI agents from the terminal. https://kelam.sh
#
# Tap-style formula: the sdist named by `url` is installed into a private virtualenv,
# and pip resolves the dependencies (all pure-python or prebuilt wheels) from PyPI at
# install time. That keeps a version bump to two lines (url + sha256) — the release
# workflow in samsadsam/kelam rewrites them automatically on every tagged release.
